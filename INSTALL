Quick compilation instructions (pmx - April 2022):

For Linux Mint / Ubuntu 20.04.

First, you need the base package of X11 bitmap fonts in 75dpi.
Install either : 

    xfonts-75dpi (US ASCII encoding)
or 
    xfonts-75dpi-transcoded (extended to others encodings, like iso5589-15)

There is a bug in the XForms libs distributed with the Debian/Ubunt
based distributions.

An updated version is available.
*) Install a modified version of libforms-dev from :
   https://github.com/pmxy/XForms_FIXED_2022_04_28/blob/master/libforms-dev_1.2.4-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb
*) Install a modified version of libforms-bin from :
   https://github.com/pmxy/XForms_FIXED_2022_04_28/blob/master/libforms-bin_1.2.4-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb

The general build instruction are :
    ./configure
    make
    make install

The default install directory is /usr/local/lib/imperium, and the executable "impfe" goes in /bin

If you want to compile with the backgroud MP3 audio player :
*) install libao-dev and mpg123-dev 
*) invoque configure with the switch --with-audio 
   ./configure --with-audio 

To actually play (loop) audio, impfe must be invoqued as
 
   impfe --play-audio


If you want a private install, for example in $HOME/.local :
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local --bindir==$HOME/.local/bin
or
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local --bindir==$HOME/.local/bin --with-audio

The install directory is (prefix)/lib/imperium, e.g. $HOME/.local/lib/imperium

If the audio is enabled with --with-audio, a default MP3 audio file 
will be installed in the install direcory

The embedded background audio player ill play the file impfe.music.mp3.
This file will be searched, first in the user HOME directory, then 
in the imperium install directory. 

impfe accepts the command following commanline options :

    impfe --help            : Usage info
    impfe --play-audio      : Loops the MP3 audio file in the background

Default server port for Imperium is 3458
